TheOne pillars are:
- Documentation
- Simplicity
- SOLID

## Modules

# History of TheOne
TheOne is a project for the subject of Game Engines in our 3rd year at CITM (UPC).  
Our team had 3 months to create a game engine from scratch.

## Goals
Our goals for this project were:
- Understanding the architecture of a game engine
- Making a game engine as simple as possible
- Producing SOLID modern code
- Creating a game with our engine
- Dealing with a long-term project
- Developping documentation for developers and end-users

## Pre-production
We spent the first weeks designing our initial architecture, setting up the template with the libraries, and defining the rules to keep a maintainable code during the whole project.

## Production
The production made us realize that our idea of a game engine was naive. Our architecture evolved through the knowledge acquired in class.
