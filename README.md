# 1. What is TheOne
## 1.1. Description
TheOne is a game engine crafted with passion by [Héctor Báscones](https://github.com/Hekbas), [Arnau Jiménez](https://github.com/Historn) and [Júlia Serra](https://github.com/softdrawss).

TheOne pillars are:
- Documentation
- Simplicity
- SOLID

## 1.2. Modules
- `TheOneEngine`: Uses EngineCore, asset dependent, for any game built with TheOne
- `TheOneEditor`: Uses EngineCore, expose game development to the end-user

# 2. History of TheOne
## 2.1. Context
TheOne is a project for the subject of Game Engines in our 3rd year at CITM (UPC).  
Our team ([Héctor Báscones](https://github.com/Hekbas), [Arnau Jiménez](https://github.com/Historn), [Júlia Serra](https://github.com/softdrawss)) had 3 months to create a game engine from scratch.

## 2.2. Goals
Our goals for this project were:
- Understanding the architecture of a game engine
- Making a game engine as simple as possible
- Producing SOLID modern code
- Creating a game with our engine
- Dealing with a long-term project
- Developping documentation for developers and end-users

## 2.3. Pre-production
We spent the first weeks designing our initial architecture, setting up the template with the libraries, and defining the rules to keep a maintainable code during the whole project.

## 2.4. Production
The production made us realize that our idea of a game engine was naive. Our architecture evolved through the knowledge acquired in class.
